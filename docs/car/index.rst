C64 Archives (.car files)
=========================

A C64 Archive (``.car`` file) is similar to a tarball (``.tar`` or ``.tar.gz`` file), containing files and/or directories, possibly compressed, all concatenated into a single file for easier transfer between drives or machines.

That is to say: multiple files can be combined into one, preserving their directory structure for when those files are re-extracted later.

C64 Archives can also serve as "installers" for software and updates. Any archive with the "install" type can be automatically extracted to the OS root by double-clicking the file inside C64 OS.

An archive must contain a single root entry -- which means if you want to store multiple files, the root entry must be a directory.

Note: For now, compression is not supported.
