Welcome to the documentation for ``c64os-util``, a Python package.

This package provides a collection of classes, methods, and scripts that allow you to parse, generate, or manipulate certain types of files that are used in C64 OS. This package is useful to developers who are cross-assembling C64 OS applications and wish to package up their resources as part of the build pipeline.

`C64 OS <https://c64os.com/>`_ is an operating system designed for the Commodore 64 designed by Gregory Nacu and released in 2022. It provides a rich graphical toolkit, customizeable launcher, peripheral drivers, multimedia formats, and a collection of utilities and applications.
